# YouTube clone using React & MaterialUI

I tried building a website that works exactly like YouTube. I used MaterialUI components in React. This refreshed all my knowledge about React and modern frontend libraries. 

## Steps to build the project locally


1. ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/rk47-coder/youtube_clone.git
    ```
2. ```bash
    cd youtube_clone
    ```
3. ```bash
    npm i
    ```
4. ```bash
    npm start
    ```
