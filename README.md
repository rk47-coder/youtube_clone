# YouTube clone using React & MaterialUI

I tried building a website that works exactly like YouTube. I used MaterialUI components in React. This refreshed all my knowledge about React and modern frontend libraries. 

## Steps to build the project locally


- git clone https://github.com/rk47-coder/youtube_clone.git
- `cd youtube_clone`
- `npm i`
- `npm start`
